# SkanniApp v1.0.29 - Hybrid OCR for Icelandic Receipts

## 🎯 **Major Release: Complete Hybrid OCR Implementation**

This release introduces a revolutionary hybrid OCR system specifically designed to solve Icelandic VAT parsing issues on receipts.

---

## 🚀 **Key Features**

### **Hybrid OCR Engine**
- **Intelligent dual-engine system** combining ML Kit and Tesseract
- **Automatic engine selection** based on content analysis
- **Icelandic character optimization** (þæöðÞÆÖÐ detection)
- **Enhanced number parsing** for Icelandic "1.234,56" format

### **VAT Parsing Improvements**
- ✅ **Strict validation**: Only accepts valid Icelandic VAT rates (24% and 11%)
- ❌ **Eliminates errors**: Rejects invalid rates like 5.0%
- 🇮🇸 **Icelandic-optimized**: Better recognition of Icelandic text patterns

### **Smart Engine Selection**
The app automatically chooses the best OCR engine:
- **Tesseract** when Icelandic characters detected
- **Tesseract** when high confidence scores
- **Tesseract** when better number patterns found
- **ML Kit fallback** for speed and reliability

## 📱 **What's Fixed**

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| ❌ "VSK 5.0%" parsing errors | ✅ Strict 24%/11% validation |
| ❌ Poor Icelandic character recognition | ✅ Tesseract with Icelandic training data |
| ❌ Wrong number formatting | ✅ Enhanced "1.234,56" parsing |
| ❌ Single OCR engine limitations | ✅ Intelligent dual-engine system |
